# For Math App

* provide a view-switching tab/iconset at top to switch between calculator, flashcard, and worksheet modes
  * provide a print option for worksheets
  * allow user to select number of problems per page (within a reasonable range) and problem scope (digits per value, construction of problems)
* add user accounts, login/auth
  * add quiz capabilities using both flashcard and worksheet interfaces
  * track scoring, permanently, following the model of keybr.com
* design a flashcard mode to drill on any type of problem, or even theory and terminology (this now becomes direct overlap with Quotes app and central to CurriculumFor.Life)
  * focus on mastery of ten times tables - the foundation of all decimal-based integer math, essential for all people
    * also drill on the decimal system itself, another fundamental essential
  * consider using some kid-friendly imagery, like Pokemon, to add interest to the math. Possibly give them an option, using for example Starwars API (SWAPI) and then some kind of nature imagery API
  * add precision for division setting 
  * make a component for stacked division notation
