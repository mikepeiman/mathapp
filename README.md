# MathApp

## Because sometimes you just want simple printable arithmetic worksheets for your kiddo

I'm a fulltime homeschooling single Dad. I consider basic arithmetic to be one of the essential foundations, and as I was teaching my daughter, I found sites where I could download worksheets - but they were pre-made, and it was time-consuming to sor through poor UIs, and they often required a paid membership.

So, as a developer, I built a little app to generate math worksheets.

It's not complete, but it is functional. It even has full auth and saving/loading of worksheets(thanks to Supabase integration).

Many things TODO here, but the most important, which I do intend to complete at some point (in 2023...! I hope)
- [ ] connect the settings functions with the UI, and improve UI layout for all settings, incl. saved worksheets
- [ ] add a print option that make a clean format for printing or downloading as .pdf
- [ ] add Stripe integration... because a man can dream of making some money off his work 
- [ ] add complexity with paranthesis, so we have the full BEDMAS experience, allowing indefinitely-long multi-value/multi-operation problems
